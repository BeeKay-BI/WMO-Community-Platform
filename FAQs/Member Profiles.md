The Member Profiles provide key information on the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of WMO Members, including existing capabilities, and priority gaps which may require attention, intervention or further investment. WMO Members can use these profiles to assess the status of their NMHSs in comparison with other Members. Furthermore, the Profiles will inform partner entities interested in the work of NMHSs.

Members also have the ability to submit new information to update their Profiles as and when necessary, and visitors will be able to see when the latest updates were made.

As WMO continues digitalizing and centralizing data provided by Members, the Member Profiles will evolve, with additional information integrated.
