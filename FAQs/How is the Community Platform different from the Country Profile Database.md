The Platform is also referred to as the CPDB/Extranet (v3.0). In 2019, it was renamed the “WMO Community Platform” to better communicate its expanded features. When all Members are regularly working with the Community Platform, we will move to a new level of collaboration among Members and the Secretariat. The Platform will include the kind of information found in previous versions but more and with more functionality. With the addition of user “identity management” a new contact database just for our community’s needs was created (Expert Database). The Platform now includes information sharing mechanisms as well as powerful collaborative and analytic tools.
