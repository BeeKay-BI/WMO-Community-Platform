Dear **XXXX**

Our team is actively working on cleaning up the [WMO Experts Database](https://contacts.wmo.int/all_members) to have an accurate representation of our Members. 

We would like to collaborate with you and your team in updating (adding, editing, removing) Experts listed under your country.  

Once an acknowledgement is received, we will share an excel file with the Experts from **Mali** and provide instructions on how to proceed. With your help, we will update information and populate the WMO Experts Database with accurate information. 

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.  

Best regards, 
**XXXX** on behalf of the WMO Community Platform Team.
