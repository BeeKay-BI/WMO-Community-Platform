Background
The WMO Community Platform is a tool that gives WMO members and partners control of the information they share with the WMO secretariat, and the ability to facilitate the nomination and management of members’ and partners’ involvement in WMO related activities.

Experts Database (contacts.wmo.int) is the first component of the new WMO Community platform (community.wmo.int) that has been developed. It allows authorized users to maintain information about members and partners’ contacts and group memberships.

In this guide you will find instructions on how to manage your Experts Profile, Groups, and Group Memberships. Furthermore we have added sections that will help you navigate the Experts Database smoothly.

Permanent Representatives have been asked to nominate “Agency Approvers” who will be authorized to represent their respective organizations. Agency Approvers will be able to add and remove contacts, nominate experts for participation in groups, and change nominations. They act on behalf on PRs when a PR cannot carry out a certain task.
